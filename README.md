# ðŸŽ„ 24 Days Advent SQL Challenge ðŸŽ„

I recently completed the **24-day SQL Advent Challenge** by **Dawn Choo**, and itâ€™s been such an exciting and rewarding experience! Tackling a new SQL problem every day helped me strengthen my skills, learn from my mistakes, and discover new ways to approach complex queries.

## ðŸ’¡ Big Takeaways from the Challenge:

1. **Consistency is Key:** Working on a challenge daily helped me build strong habits and stay focused.
2. **Learn by Doing:** Practical problems give more confidence than just theory.
3. **Mistakes:** Every mistake helped me grow, refine my approach, and better understand SQL.

Hereâ€™s a Power BI dashboard showcasing my journey through the challenge, including my favorite questions from the 24 days. This visual summary captures the effort, learning, and fun I had along the way!

Thank you, **Dawn Choo**, for creating such a meaningful challenge. Itâ€™s been a fantastic way to sharpen my SQL skills, and Iâ€™m excited to keep building from here!
